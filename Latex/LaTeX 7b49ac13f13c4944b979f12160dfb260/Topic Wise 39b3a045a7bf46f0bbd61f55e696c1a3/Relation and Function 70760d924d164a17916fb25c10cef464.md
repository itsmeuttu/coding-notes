| $f^{-1}(y)$ | Inverse function of y |  |
| $f \circ g$ | Composition of functions f and g | $f \circ g$ |
| $x \in A$ | Element x belongs to set A | $x \in A$ |
| $x \notin A$ | Element x does not belong to set A | $x \notin A$ |
| $A \subseteq B$ | Set A is a subset of set B | $A \subseteq B$ |
| $A \subset B$ | Set A is a proper subset of set B | $A \subset B$ |
