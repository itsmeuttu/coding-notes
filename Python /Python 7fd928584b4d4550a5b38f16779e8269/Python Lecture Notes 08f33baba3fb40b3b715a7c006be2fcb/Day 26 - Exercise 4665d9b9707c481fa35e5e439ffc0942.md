# Day 26 - Exercise

**Q**. Create a python program capable of greeting you with Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening. Your program should use time module to get the current hour. Here is a sample program and documentation link for you:

Sol:

```python
import time
t = int(time.strftime("%H"))
if t > 0 and t<=12:
    print("GOOD MORNING")
elif t >= 12 and t <=15:
    print("GOOD NOON")
elif t >= 15 and t <= 22:
    print("GOOD EVENING")
else:
    print("GOOD NIGHT")
